# README Generator
### Module 10 Challenge


This project is a README Generator built using Node.js. It aims to automate the creation of high-quality README files for software projects. The README Generator prompts the user with a series of questions about their project, such as project name, description, installation instructions, usage guidelines, and contribution guidelines. Based on the user's responses, the generator generates a well-structured README file with the provided information. The README file includes sections for project description, installation, usage, contributing, and license. By using this tool, developers can save time and ensure consistent and professional documentation for their projects.
